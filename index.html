                <p> I was born on the 2nd of February in the year 2000. I was born in Camarillo,
                California and moved to Fresno when I was 10 years old with my mom. I live in Fresno now
                with my mom, stepdad and two younger brothers. One of my little brothers is 13 and the other 
                one is 8. I also have two dogs, Tyger and Wolfy. I have had Tyger for 4 years and Wolfy for 2. </p>
	            <p> I donâ€™t have many hobbies, but I do a lot of things. I do track and field and
	            tennis at Roosevelt. I play ps4 and ps3 sometimes- not much anymore because I have a lot of homework 
	            and work. I have a lot of goals in life, so I work towards them with school. </p>
